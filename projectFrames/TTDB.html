      TTDB Was a website I created for my Intro to ITWS course freshman year. The goal of this site was to create a drag and drop deck builder for the minigame Table Turf in the third person shooter Splatoon 3. I learned a lot about UI/UX design, user testing, database management, and more during this project. The website is no longer being hosted, but the source code is <u><a href="https://github.com/abrookst/TTDB/" target="_blank">here</a></u>.
