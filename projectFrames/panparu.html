      <p>Inspired by Tamagotchi's, this game was made for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam-2023"><u>2023
          Low Rez Jam</u></a>! Thus, the game had to be 64x64, which was a very interesting development challenge! I mostly
        worked on the UI, which is always an interesting challenge at low resolutions. But outside of that, Tamagotchi's
        already being on LCD displays almost gave us more breathing room. But one challenge challenge came when we had to
        design a game, of which we stuck with tetris! A lot of the blocks are similarly colored, since we stuck with a 
        6-color palette, but I think it worked out well. I also learned a lot about real world time passing, and how it can
        affect games. Overall, this was a great experience.</p>
