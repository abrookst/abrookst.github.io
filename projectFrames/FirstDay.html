  <p>This game was made for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/ssjnarrative"><u>2023
        SSJN 2023</u></a>! Which had a focus on a heavy narrative. While this project took a lot out of me, since I was
    working a full time job at Firaxis while writing and programming this game entirely by myself. But I am proud of
    quite a few things, one of those being the aesthetic. I was heavily inspired by games like Cult of the Lamb,
    Hotline Miami, Control, and Neon White. Additionally, I wanted to give all of the characters distinct voices, but
    without having to hire/scout full on voice actors. So I decided to go with an Animal Crossing style garbled
    gibbirish. There was already a library for this for Renpy! But it had not ben updated to the latest version of
    Renpy/Python 3.
    So I forked the original, and created a new updated version, you can check that out <a
